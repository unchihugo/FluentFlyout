## Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is handled in FluentFlyout.

### 1. Information We Collect
FluentFlyout **does not** collect, store, or process any personal data from users. As a background utility application, it does not require any user-specific information to function. 

While the application itself does not collect data, the platform through which you install the app (Microsoft Store) may collect certain technical and usage information automatically (see Section 3).

### 2. Cookies and Tracking
FluentFlyout does not use cookies, tracking pixels, or any custom telemetry within its own code to monitor or track user activity.

### 3. Microsoft Store Analytics & Windows Diagnostics
Depending on your installation method and Windows settings, Microsoft may automatically collect certain diagnostic and usage data:

*   **Microsoft Store Version:** If you installed FluentFlyout from the Microsoft Store, Microsoft collects standard analytics, including app acquisitions (downloads), active usage sessions, and hardware configuration (e.g., OS version, device type).
*   **App Health:** Microsoft automatically collects "Health" data, such as crash reports, hang reports, and performance metrics (e.g., memory usage). This data is provided to the developer in an anonymous, aggregated format to help improve the application.
*   **Windows Diagnostic Data:** For both the Store and MSIX (GitHub) versions, Windows may collect information about how the app performs if you have enabled "Diagnostic data" in your Windows Privacy Settings.

For more information on what Microsoft collects, please refer to the [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement).

### 4. Third-Party Services
FluentFlyout does not share any personal information with third-party services. The only third-party interaction occurs at the system level via the Microsoft Store or Windows OS for the purposes of delivery, updates, and reliability reporting as described in Section 3.

### 5. Data Security
Since no personal information is collected or stored by the application, there are no specific security measures required for the storage of user data. We rely on the security of the Microsoft Store and GitHub for the safe distribution of the application binaries.

### 6. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We reserve the right to update this Privacy Policy at any time. Any changes will be reflected in the updated version available in the app’s repository.
